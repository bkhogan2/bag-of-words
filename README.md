This tutorial will help you get started with Word2Vec for natural language processing. It has two goals:   Basic Natural Language Processing: Part 1 of this tutorial is intended for beginners and covers basic natural language processing techniques, which are needed for later parts of the tutorial.  Deep Learning for Text Understanding: In Parts 2 and 3, we delve into how to train a model using Word2Vec and how to use the resulting word vectors for sentiment analysis.  Since deep learning is a rapidly evolving field, large amounts of the work has not yet been published, or exists only as academic papers. Part 3 of the tutorial is more exploratory than prescriptive -- we experiment with several ways of using Word2Vec rather than giving you a recipe for using the output.  To achieve these goals, we rely on an IMDB sentiment analysis data set, which has 100,000 multi-paragraph movie reviews, both positive and negative.
